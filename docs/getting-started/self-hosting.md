# Self hosting

Self hosting allows you to get **your mocks closest to you and/or your organization**. It has all the **same features** as the "official" option.

### Advantages

- **Mocks are way quicker** since you are running them way closer than we are.
- **You** and **only you** have **access to your own data**, we don't collect any data from your instances.
- Allows you to **circumvent your organization firewalls**.
