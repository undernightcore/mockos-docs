# Your first project

The **main dashboard is your central hub**, displaying all the projects you're involved in. If this is your first time, it's likely you won't have any projects yet. Don't worry, we have two simple ways to kickstart your journey:

- **Create Your Own Project**: [Jump to instructions](#creating-your-own-project).
- **Join an Existing Project**: [Learn how](#getting-invited-to-a-project).

## Creating your own project

- **Click the plus button** located within the **"Your Projects" section**.
- A popup will appear, prompting you to provide a **name and an optional description**.

- On this page, you'll find a list of **all the projects you've been invited to**.
- **Select the desired project card** and **confirm your request**.
